#### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

it is where the  controlled by it is a value input form element from React. 

 

#### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

It is get update once the user write the input. and this value we will use it. 

 

#### Why would we use a ternary operator?

to make the code more cleaner. 

#### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement: if(x===y){ console.log(true); } else { console.log(false); } x === y?

console.log(true) ,
console.log(false);
