### FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

1- is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

2- A pure function is a function which:
-Given the same input, will always return the same output.
- Produces no side effects.

3- One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments.

4- Immutable data cannot change its structure or the data in it. It's setting a value on a variable that cannot change, making that value a fact, or sort of like a source of truth — the same way a princess kisses a frog hoping it will turn into a handsome prince.

5- In functional programming, referential transparency is generally defined as the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value) without changing the result of the program.


#### Modules in node js

1- Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application. Each module in Node. js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.

2- to ask for authoritatively or imperatively; demand. to impose need or occasion for; make necessary or indispensable: The work required infinite patience. to call for or exact as obligatory; ordain: The law requires annual income-tax returns.

3- 
- Local/File-based modules: It define the Node modules within a file in our application and is used within our application.
- Core modules: The core modules are inbuilt modules in Node. js. ...
- Third-party modules: Third-party modules are the external Node modules.
