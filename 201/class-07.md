***Tables***

In fact, we need to use tables to display some informations. The grid format is the way that the table present the informations. 

**Note:Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.**

We use the tr tage to indicate the start of the table and the td tag to end the table.


For the long tables we  split the table into a thead tag, tbody tag, and tfoot tag.

***Object Constructor***

We use object constroctor to make a new blanck object.

Use object()constroctor to make new one. Then you can use methods and proparty inside it. 

To update a proparty use dot or sequre bracket.Moreover,a function in global scope When a function is created at the top level of a script (that is, not inside another object or function), then it is in the global scope or global context.

Inside the  JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. In order to make your data orgnized organize, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

If you are inside the object and you want to acsses a proparty name or key use object but the keys needs to be a unique values. 

There are six datatypes in JS:
1- String
2- Number
3-Boolean
4-Undefined
5-Null
6-0bject
