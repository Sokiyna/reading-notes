***Colors***

By using colors you can bring your page to life and make it more attractive. 

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. There is three ways to specify colors in CSS:

1- rgb values
2- hex codes
3- color names

Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified
next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.

***Texts***

The formatting of your text can have a significant effect on how readable your pages are. As we look through these
properties I will also give you some design tips on how to display your type.

The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.


***JPEG vs PNG vs GIF***

**JPEG** is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality.

**PNG** is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.

**GIF** is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm. It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing
