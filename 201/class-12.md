**Charts**

Charts are much butter in present the data than tables or forms, and the chart is easier to create than the chart.

 Chart.js, is a JavaScript plugin which uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.


 **Set your Chart.js up**


 1-  Download Chart.js
 2-Copy Chart.min.js from the unzipped folder inside the directory you will be working in, then create a new html to import the script.

 3- Create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart

 4-  write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas.
 5- Inside the same script tags create your data.



 **Note: The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. Plus, once you’ve mastered the basics here, you’ll discover that there are tons of options listed in the documentation.**


 ***Canves***

 Canves look like the the img element, with the only obvious difference being that it doesn't contain the src and alt attributes. Actually, the canvas element has only two attributes, width and height. 

 The rendering context

 fixed-size drawing surface that created by Canvas element which exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering; for instance, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.
