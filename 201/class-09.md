***Forms***

While we are adding a simple search box to our website or if we need to create more complicated insurance applications,
HTML forms give us a group of elements to collect data from.

several kinds of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site:

1- Adding Text.
2-Making Choice.
3-Submitting Forms.


The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.

userName = lol
userName is name and lol is value

The form element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute also.

**Note: form validation when the form give the user alret to take their attention that the form filled incorrectly**


***Lists, Tables and Forms***

The list-style-type property allows us to control the shape and style of a bullet point (also known as a marker).


Unordered Lists For an unordered list you can use the following values:

- none
- disc
- circle
- square

Lists are made to the page by default and the list-styleposition property indicates if the marker should
appear on the inside or the outside of the box which  contain the main points.

width : to set the width of the table.
padding :  to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content.
text-transform:  to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase.

**Note: In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements,there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.**
