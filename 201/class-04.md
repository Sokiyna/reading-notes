**Links**

Links are the describing feature of the web page because it is allow us to move from page to page. 

Here are some types of links: 

1- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page.

2- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

3- Links that open in a new browser window.

To creat a link we use <a> element, and href to write the link inside it.

Relative URLs

We can use Relative URLs  when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.


***Note: You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field***


**Layout**

We can use normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats, to different ways of he element. Also we use grids to make the web page more proffessional. 

In fact, CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

specific task. We can reuse the function if different part of the script need it. 
 We can use the function value by return it wich is basically a return value.
