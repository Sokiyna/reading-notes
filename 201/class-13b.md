***Transforms**

 CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements in interesting way. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

 Transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Every one come with their own individual properties and values.

 **Note: transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property.**

 Combining Transforms

 Multiple transformars are used to be once, for example rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time . In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.
