***CSS Layout***

Css treat html elements as a box, each box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

We can indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)

**Note: When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.**

There are four types of positions in CSS:

1-position:static
2-position:relative
3-position:absolute
4- position:fixed


**Note: Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.**
